## Installation
In order to use this application, the following packages need to be installed:
package.json: npm init -y
MySQL2: npm i mysql2
Express: npm i express
Sequelize: npm i sequelize
Dotenv: npm i dotenv
As mentioned above, it also requires a development platform to test the results.
 
## Usage
This project needs to be run by the command line, which can be accessed by opening the server.js file in the integrated terminal and start it by typing ‘npm run seed’, and then 'node server.js’. It's also important to run the schema file by starting mysql, and running 'SOURCE schema.sql'. Once all packages have been installed and commands have been run, the user needs to open the chosen development platform and start testing the application by selecting the desired route. If any questions, please refer to the demonstration, which was done using Thunder Client.
